# Xamarin.Plugin.Health
HealthKit/GoogleFit plugin for Xamarin Forms

*Work in progess. Soon will be available a nuget package & documentation!*

I'm actively working on this plugin right now, i think it will be ready to use by the end of August 2020.

The "read" part is 90% done, currently i'm working to normalize Calories count as GoogleFit and Healthkit use different methods (healthkit has Active & Base Calories, while GoogleFit total and daily average BMR).

After that, will come write and delete.

In the end i plan to add Workout session reading, maybe in a future release.

When the plugin will be ready, detailed documentation will be added. For now there are too many moving parts.
